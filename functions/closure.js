// Closure is a javaScript features that happens automatically
// Closure is an internal property of a Function, it's NOT an Object - can't access it directly
// However, we can take a look at this 'internal Scopes property' in the console.
// Closure automatically happens in certain Situations & we just have to recognize it
const secureBooking = function () {
  let passengerCount = 0;

  return function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passengers`);
  };
};
// now booker variable is a function as well - function call
const booker = secureBooking();
booker();
booker();

// NOTE: 'booker' function exists in Global Scope.
// The environment in which the function is created - secureBooking function
// is no longer active since it exited the global execution context.
// BUT still the 'booker' function somehow continues to have access to the VARIABLE - passengerCount
// that was present at the time the 'secureBooking' function was created.
// THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE 'CLOSURE' DOES.
// So we can say that the CLOSURE makes the Function remember all variables that EXISTED
// at the function BIRTH PLACE.

// Closure is like a person who doesnâ€™t loose connection to his/her hometown even after leaving hometown
// Everything can be still access by the memory/reference

// Closure is an internal property of a Function, it's NOT an Object - can't access it directly
// However, we can take a look at this internal property - [[Scopes]], where the CLOSURE is defined
// [[]] - meaning we can not access it directly from our code
console.dir(booker);
