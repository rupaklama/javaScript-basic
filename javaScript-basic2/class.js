// ES6 classes - nicer & modern syntax
// Javascript is not a class based language but a prototype based language. 
// JavaScript is an object-based language based on prototypes, rather than being class-based.

// NOTE - Every Functions in a javaScript automatically have a property - 'Prototype' 
// & Constructor Function is one of it. With Prototype property, we can make copy of Methods & Properties and reuse it.
// Now, Every Object created by Certain Constructor Function will get access to all 
// the methods and properties defined in Constructor Prototype Property.

// class expression
// const Person = class {}

// class declaration
class Person {
  // first thing we need to do is to add a CONSTRUCTOR method of this class
  // It is executed automatically when a new object is created
  // It is used to initialize object properties

  // note - The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. 
  // initial properties as arguments in the constructor
  constructor(firstName, birthYear) {
    // Person.firstName = firstName - meaning firstName property of Person object is equal to value we receive
    // Object's properties
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.birthYear = birthYear;
    // note: this keyword inside of constructor will also be set to the newly created empty object
  }

  // methods - Shorthand method definition
  // Methods will be added to .prototype property of Person class for inheritance
  calcAge() {
    console.log(2021 - this.birthYear);
  }

  // Another thing, we can add STATIC methods - simply attached to the class
  // which are not inherited by class instances / object created by class. 
  // Static methods are often used to create utility functions / helper methods
  static greeting() {
    console.log('hi there!')
  }

}
// When you have a class, you can use the class to create objects
// The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created
const indira = new Person('Indira', 1987);
console.log(indira);

// indira.greeting(); - this will result in error, this static method cannot be access here

// Able to access class method because of Prototypal Inheritance 
// NOTE: If property or method can't be found in object, javaScript will look into object's prototype. 
// Prototype is inherited properties or methods. 
// Prototype helps optimize performance since each object can access properties and methods from its prototype
// instead of listing on them again. 
indira.calcAge();



// another example
class Player {
  // constructor is to create and initialize object properties

  // ES6 features - we can declare variables inside of a class as a default object properties
  //  PlayerÂ {score: 0, numLives: 10, first: 'blue', last: 'steele'}
  // INITIAL DEFAULT VALUES

  // A public variable is accessible from anywhere (well, anywhere where the class is accessible).

  // A private variable is only accessible inside the class.

  // A static variable belongs to the class rather than to an instance of a class.

  // private field/property - should be only use/accessible inside of this Class only
  // to stop changing/reassigning it's value from other Class Instances
  #score = 0;
  #numLives = 10;

  // static property
  static description = "only exists on this class only, not on the class instances";

  // first thing, we need to do is add a Constructor method
  // Constructor is actually a method of this class
  constructor(first, last) {
    // These values can be reassigned here
    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;

    // calling private method inside this class
    this.#taunt();
  }

  // getter method - to define a getter method to get the property value
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.first} ${this.last}`;
  }
  get score() {
    return this.#score;
  }

  // setter method -  to define a setter method to set the property value
  set score(newScore) {
    if (newScore < 0) {
      throw new Error("Score must be positive");
    }
    this.#score = newScore;
  }

  set fullName(newName) {
    const [first, last] = newName.split(" ");
    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;
  }

  // Static class methods are defined on the class itself.
  // You cannot call a static method on an object instance, only on this object class
  // note - you have static method to create certain functionality related to this class only - helper method
  static randomPlayer() {
    new Player("me", "you");
  }

  // private method - not accessible in other Class Instances
  #taunt() {
    console.log("Yeah");
  }

  loseLife() {
    this.numLives -= 1;
  }
}

// inheritance - one class extends another
class AdminPlayer extends Player {
  isAdmin = true;

  constructor(powers) {
    // super() method in the constructor method is to call the parent's constructor method
    // and gets access to the parent's properties and methods:
    super();

    this.powers = powers;
  }
}
const admin = new AdminPlayer(["delete", "restore"]);

// new object instance
// Newly created Object also has an access to properties/methods of Class which is a Function
// and Function is an Object in javaScript.
// Prototypal Inheritance - inheriting from One Object from Another Object - Class Object here
const player1 = new Player("Rupak", "Lama");

// calling Getter methods as if a class property that we defined
console.log(player1.fullName);
console.log(player1.score);

// setter method to set value
player1.score = 10;
player1.fullName = "Indira Rai";

console.log(player1);
